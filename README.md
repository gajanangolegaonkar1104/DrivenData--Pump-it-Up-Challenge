# DrivenData--Pump-it-Up-Challenge

The R file can be found in the repository.</br>
The data files can be downloaded from the DrivenData.org</br>
Look for the comments in the code for feature engineering and handling of missing values</br>
Just copy paste the code in your Rstudio, assign paths to the data files and you are good to go!</br>
